  rules: "\n Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker.\n
      The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write,\n
      creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.\n
      The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).\n
      In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers.\n
      The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs -  or - or empty spaces.  \n
      A  indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers,\n
      in the secret code and in the same position.\n
      For example:\n
      Secret number - 1234\n
      Input number - 6264 \n
      Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
      A - indicates a number match:  \n
      one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers,\n
      in the secret code but in a different position.\n
      For example:\n
      Secret number - 1234\n
      Input number - 6462\n
      Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
      An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n
      If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number\n
      - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.\n
      Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty).\n
      If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.\n
      \nChoose option one of several possible scenarios:
      \nstart, rules, stats, exit.\n "
